# Axis layout rework — running progress log

> Purpose: session-survivable state. Updated and committed **after every step** so any
> session (or a fresh one after a token cutoff) knows exactly where to resume.
> Canonical plan + task definitions: `docs/axis_layout_rework_review_and_remaining_plan.md`.
> Design source of truth: `docs/workbench-dc-parity/01…06-*.md` (extracted specs) and the
> `design/*.dc.html` live set.

## How to resume

1. `git log --oneline` on branch `layout-rework` — every landed step is one commit below.
2. Read **Next queue** for the next task to start; read the task's section in the plan doc
   and the matching `docs/workbench-dc-parity/` spec before implementing.
3. Verify green before starting: `npm run check` (0 errors) and `npx vitest run` must pass.
4. Update this log (Landed + Next queue) after every landed step.

## Current state — 2026-07-06 ~13:20

- Branch `layout-rework`, working tree **clean**, `npm run check` 0 errors,
  vitest **223/223** across 41 files.
- All four tasks interrupted by the 2026-07-06 morning token cutoff were recovered
  (partial work salvaged from the tree + stopped-agent transcripts) and are committed.

## Landed (chronological, this branch)

| Commit | Task | What |
|---|---|---|
| `3841470`…`240f6e8` | T01 | Dockable workbench foundation batches |
| `b6b1500` | T04–T06 | Panel singletons, rename validation, reducer command tests |
| `aa3b69d` | T16 (part 1) | Edit ribbon + library drawer tokenization |
| `d28562b` | T03 | Functional gridbar toolbar (grid mode + block size widgets) |
| `4572610` | — | Singleton keys on default Axis panels |
| `11eed7f` | extraction | Six DC parity spec docs (`docs/workbench-dc-parity/01–06`) |
| `eb711c3` | **T02** | Phone blank render root fix: persisted dock node ids collide with fresh-session id counters → duplicate keyed-each ids crash the dock render. Fix: `reserveWorkbenchIds` + duplicate-node-id validate/repair (`workbench/core/ids.ts`, `invariants.ts`), Axis store adopts the repaired doc. 6 regression tests. |
| `636e0ea` | grid map | `'map'` grid mode + pane-relative auto stepping per `04-fc-and-grid.md` §2 (`resolveAxisGridMetrics`: min-cols 56/72/96, map ≤42px, full ≤140px, 4-row height cap); SignalGrid map strip-down; mobile paging path untouched. |
| `a51e07a` | **T07/T08** | Five design widgets (logo, gridMap dots, fcDevice/fcLayouts/fcSwitchView bound to live FC controller) + `axis.meterToggle` (→ `editor.meteringOn`/`canMeterBlocks`); mini tap-to-cycle + 380/100ms hold-to-repeat (`widgets/widgetControls.ts`). |
| `e86661a` | **T12** | Preset-browser split-pane parity: 14-row soft cap + expander, list-part query bar (advanced↔simple conversion, sort, filter chips), quick tags, owner rank rule `list<detail<sources<full` (typed replacement for `__PBBus.owner()`), verbatim query-grammar port (`presetBrowser/presetBrowserWorkbenchQuery.ts`). |
| T34 | landed earlier inside T01/T03 series | Geometry-transition guard |
| `6b224d4` | **T09/T10** | Live nav targets (Setup/Controllers → docked VirtualScreen; Scenes/Live → placeholder panels; add-or-focus semantics in `axisWorkbenchNavigationActions.ts`), Theme nav entry, bottom-zone hint ticker + legal widgets. Nav-id reconciliation deferred to T31. |

## Verification debt (needs hardware / a device or browser session)

> Operator decision 2026-07-06: visual checks happen **once, in one batch, after all
> implementation tasks are finished** — keep appending items here, don't block on them.

- **T02 phone fix**: reproduce only with a *stale persisted layout* + fresh session — a clean
  profile won't show it. Verify on the actual phone before closing T02 in the plan.
- Grid map/auto stepping, meter toggle, FC widgets, PB split panes: visually verified only
  via tests; browser smoke (Claude-in-Chrome on :5173) still pending.
- T09/T10: nav entries dock/focus the right panels, placeholder styling, hint ticker,
  legal links (Ko-fi/imprint open externally), theme entry opens the theme dialog.

## Deliberately deferred (documented in commits / agent reports)

- T12 P1/P2: full row anatomy (CPU meter, per-block chips, inline rename), context
  menus/swipe actions, detail cloud card/version restore, generic picker, builder-chip
  param editing, saved-filter inline UI. Deep param matching stays in the monolith
  (needs hydrated/decoded blocks).
- Widget library curation: meterToggle et al. not in `doc.widgetLibrary` groups —
  consistent with existing curated subset, revisit with T13.

## Next queue (in order; sequential where files conflict)

1. **Generic estW auto-fit port** — estW × 0.62 joint-fit + keep-set shedding into
   `WidgetZone`/sizing (spec: `01-shell.md`/`02-widgets.md` auto-fit section). IN FLIGHT.
2. **T33** — `be-part="modifier"` panel (spec: `05-block-editor.md`). IN FLIGHT; its
   registry registration is boundary-blocked → main session applies the reported
   one-liners on review.
3. **FC part visual parity** (spec: `04-fc-and-grid.md` §1). IN FLIGHT (restarted once:
   a stray "haiku" message derailed the first run — instructed to disregard).
4. **T13** — layout presets, driven by the six extracted preset kinds
   (default/stage/studio/compact + tablet/mobile, spec: `01-shell.md`). Waits for the
   roster to settle (after 1–3).
5. Operator's batched visual check over everything (P0: phone T02 check).

## Session conventions (from the operator)

- Implementation subagents run on **Opus 4.8**; the main session (Fable) verifies,
  reviews diffs, runs check+tests, and commits in logical chunks.
- Commits: `<scope>: <imperative>`, author `sKuhLight`, **no AI attribution** (CLAUDE.md).
- Update this log after **every** landed step.
